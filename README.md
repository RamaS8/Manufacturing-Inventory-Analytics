# Manufacturing-Inventory-Analytics
Operational analytics project focused on production and inventory performance, built with SQL Server and Power BI.
# Manufacturing & Inventory Analytics

## Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analytics solution focused on **manufacturing operations and inventory management** within an enterprise environment. The objective is to convert structured ERP-style data into meaningful insights that support operational monitoring, planning, and decision-making.

An interactive dashboard was developed using **Microsoft Power BI**, with data sourced and modeled from **SQL Server**, enabling dynamic exploration of production and inventory trends.

## Business Objective

Manufacturing organizations generate large volumes of transactional data, but actionable insights are often difficult to extract without proper modeling and visualization.  
This project aims to:

- Track inventory levels and valuation over time  
- Analyze production performance across product categories  
- Identify trends and patterns that impact operational efficiency  
- Enable data-driven decision-making through interactive dashboards  

---

## Dataset Summary

The dataset represents a simulated **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** system commonly used for analytics and BI practice. It includes structured transactional data related to:

- Manufacturing processes  
- Inventory movement and valuation  
- Product hierarchies and categories  
- Procurement and operational records  

The analysis primarily focuses on **manufacturing and inventory-related data**.

---

## Data Modeling

The data was modeled using a **star schema** design to ensure:

- Efficient querying  
- Accurate aggregations  
- High-performance dashboard visuals  

Fact tables capture transactional measures, while dimension tables provide descriptive context such as product categories and time dimensions.
